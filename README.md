Jave Programming
================

This is a shell repository to hold the result of my experiments in learning
the Java programming language.

Why?
====

For a long time, I've avoided learning Java simply because of its verbosity.
Besides, I had found a general purpose programming language: Python.
However, one cannot use Python to write Android apps. That has been my
biggest reason to want to learn Java. Also, the MOOC Algorithms, Part one
requires submissions in Java.
